      BodyFuel sprouted as a simple idea and a tool we could use as Personal trainers to help our clients reach their goals.
      One of the biggest obstacles in reaching your health and fitness goals is the nutrition aspect.
      We wanted to eliminate the stress of calorie counting, meal planning and preparation.
      Bodyfuel is FAST. HEALTHY. CONVENIENT. We pride ourselves in what we do. If you have a desire to eat healthier,
      have fresh ready-to-eat meals without the hassle of cooking and time consuming preparation, thatâ€™s what we do.
      We strive to make it an easy process from start to finish. First, we consult with you to determine your goals and how our
      services can meet your specific needs. Second, we get to work on building a meal plan. We prepare your meals Monday through Friday,
      each day will include four to six meals depending on your meal plan.
